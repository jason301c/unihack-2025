This is Onboarding - process before user can join the app

FUNCTIONALITIES:
- Collect and save user data

There are MULTIPLE PROCESSES, you can see the ordering in page.tsx.

Concept is that, page.tsx and layout.tsx handles page movements, with the help of search params (/onboarding?step=1)
The individual pages are react components, which can be treated the same as pages.
